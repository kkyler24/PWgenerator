Here I created a password generator. 

I wanted this to be put together in an easier way for my understanding of code and with the least amount of pop-ups and IF statements. I
put selected criteria together get list of characters. 
I decided to created check boxes instead of prompts as I thought this would be more user friendly, and less annyoing. I did require that they selected at least one od the check boxes, and once they have made their decision, they were required to give an input. 
I used a promptfor this on the generator button by using an eventListener. 
A function would then check if checkboxes are true and the one that are true push them into an empty array, wheich would then be randomized, rounded and dislaplayed. 

In this project I went with ease of access for both me and the user, my friends had a good ole time reseting passwords!
